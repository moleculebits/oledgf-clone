/*! \class Material
    \brief A class to represent the materials used in the stack.

    The Material class holds the properties of materials. It should be 
    used to represent all the materials contained in the stack. The class
    provides built-in interpolation to allow for the estimation of properties
    that vary considerably depending on physical conditions. For instance,
    the class contains a list of permittivities for the corresponding material, 
    such that interpolation is used to estimate and return the permittivity
    for a given wavelength.
