/*! \class Simulation
    \brief A class for energy emission simulation which inherits from baseSolver.

    The Simulation class is used to perform energy emission simulations for the material
    stack of interest. It inherits from the baseSolver base class which acts as an interface 
    for both the Simulation and Fitting classes. Thus, it shares its basic methods and members
    with the Fitting class and includes additional ones especially intented for emissions
    simulation.
